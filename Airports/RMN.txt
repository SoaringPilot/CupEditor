Stafford Regional Airport



UNICOM 122.725540-658-1212[web site][email]

The Stafford Regional Airport (RMN) is located just 25 miles south of Washington, D.C. and 50 miles north of Richmond, which is the largest metropolitan economy in the US. The airport has direct access to Interstate-95, and offers prime access to key markets. The runway is designed for coast-to-coast corporate access. Its 6,000 feet of operational capabilities eliminates the need for travel to D.C.-based airports. Located outside the Special Flight Rules Area surrounding D.C., it's simple to take a meeting in Stafford, and fly back in time for dinner.
